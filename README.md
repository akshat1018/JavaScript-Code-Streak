# JavaScript-Code-Streak
This is a description of my 20-day code streak for this assignment, which lasted from 9-01-23 to 28-01-23, and it greatly aided me in brushing up on my 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript principles because I did it on a daily basis. 

  

The following is the daily problem description: 

 

Day 1: Problem: Writing a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the two largest numbers in the array. 

Day 2: Problem: Writing a function that takes a string and returns the longest palindrome (a word that is spelled the same forwards and backwards) within the string. 
 
Day 3: Problem: Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple Calculator script. 

Day 4: Problem: Making a simple streak game where the player has to press the letter that appears on the screen as fast as possible, if the player pressed the wrong
letter the streak will reset to zero. It keeps track of the current streak and the highest streak achieved. 

Day 5: Problem: Writing a function that takes a number as an argument and returns the factorial of that number. 

Day 6: Problem: Writing a function that takes a number as an argument and returns the Fibonacci sequence up to that number. 

Day 7: Problem: Writing a function that takes a string and a number as arguments, and returns the string with each letter shifted by the given number of positions 
in the alphabet. 

Day 8: Problem: Creating a number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The user should be prompted to enter 
a guess, and the program should indicate if the guess is too high, too low, or correct using JavaScript. 

Day 9: Problem: Creating a program that generates a random password of a given length, containing a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters in JavaScript. 

Day 10: Problem: Creating a program that takes in an array of numbers and returns the mean, median, and mode of the numbers in JavaScript. 

Day 11: Problem: Creating a program that takes in a string and returns the number of times a specific substring appears in the string in JavaScript. 

Day 12: Problem:  Creating a Quiz game using HTML, CSS & JavaScript with responsiveness. 

Day 13: Problem: Implementing a basic image slider using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This image slider consists of 5 images that alternate one after the other. 

Day 14: Problem: Creating a simple to-do list application that stores the data in the browser's local storage. 

Day 15: Problem: Creating a simple Web based game. 
(The game is a simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript game where player is a blue square that can be moved using arrow keys and bounces back when reaches the edge of 
game area, it increases its size by 5 pixels and increments score by 10 points.) 

Day 16: Problem: Creating a website for a GYM using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Day 17: Problem: Creating a digital clock using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Day 18: Problem: Creating a web page that displays News headlines and summaries from multiple sources. The headlines and summaries are obtained by making API calls 
to the News API. 

Day 19: Problem: Creating a unit converter web page that converts between different units of length like- meters to kilometers, kilometers to mile and more.
